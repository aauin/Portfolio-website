      <h1>What kind of project is this?</h1>
      <p><i>Local Vibes</i> is a meticulously designed city ratings app focused on U.S. cities with 
        populations exceeding 100,000. The database-driven architecture incorporates key entities such 
        as Cities, Users, Ratings, Reviews, and Categories, facilitating a comprehensive exploration of 
        urban landscapes. The database establishes 1:M connections between Cities and Reviews, Cities 
        and Ratings, as well as M:M connections between Cities and Users, emphasizing the dynamic 
        relationship between users and city data. The Users entity captures user information, including 
        user_id, username, user_fname, user_lname, email, gender, and race_ethnicity, fostering 1:M 
        relationships with Reviews and Ratings, and M:M relationships with Cities through the Users_Cities 
        intersection table. This table manages user residencies, recording details like user_city_id, 
        user_id, city_id, start_year, end_year, and current_resident. The Reviews entity details city 
        reviews, while the Ratings entity stores category-specific scores, both forming connections with 
        Cities and Users. Categories entity defines rating and review criteria, establishing a M:1 
        relationship with Ratings. <i>Local Vibes</i> seamlessly integrates a sophisticated database structure, 
        providing users with a technically robust platform for insightful exploration of city characteristics.
