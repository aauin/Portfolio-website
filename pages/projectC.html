        <p>My team designed a mobile app, <i>Find My Move</i>, to address the challenges associated with moving. 
            The process of moving can be frustrating due to the difficulty in finding reliable services, 
            obtaining accurate cost estimates, and managing logistics. To alleviate these issues, our app 
            generates cost estimates for moving items and provides a list of services tailored to the userâ€™s 
            budget. It also includes a peer review feature to help users select the most reliable services.
            <br><br>
            To ensure the app meets user needs, we conducted interviews with individuals who had experienced 
            moving. These interviews helped us identify the main challenges movers face and the features the 
            app should include. We presented our design concepts in different formats and received a mix of 
            positive and negative feedback. Some aspects of the design were unclear to the reviewers, and one 
            team member received no feedback on his user feedback functionality. This feedback guided us in 
            refining our design.
            <br><br>
            After selecting a concept that offered the best user experience, we expanded it by adding more 
            screens and states. We then conducted two sets of tests on this improved prototype: expert 
            evaluations and user tests. Two team members performed heuristic evaluations, and we recruited 
            users from our target group for user tests. These tests provided valuable insights that helped us 
            further improve the user experience of <i>Find My Move</i>.
